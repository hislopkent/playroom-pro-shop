## 🚀 "Open The Shop" (Automation)

To keep the office monitors free for work, the simulator runs in a "Headless" state.

1.  **The Ghost:** A dummy HDMI plug creates a virtual 4K display.
2.  **The Script:** Running `scripts/open_shop.bat` launches the software and uses `nircmd` to snap the window to the hidden 4K display.
3.  **The Stream:** Sunshine captures *only* the Ghost Monitor output, beaming a perfect 4K signal to the TV.

## 🎮 Remote Controls

Custom Unified Remote panels are located in `/remotes`.

* **Awesome Golf:** Simplified interface for Mack and Brek.
* **E6 Connect:** Full simulation controls (Mulligans, Aim, Club Selection).
